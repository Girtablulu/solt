# Solt

Simple bash script file to make my life easier regarding updating packages etc.

You can download this but you need to change the paths inside solt_conf first towards your setup

```
rundeps:
	- powerline-fonts
	- silver-searcher
```

To use the command search-source you need to clone the whole phabricator git repo

# Important

You need to edit the solt_config file in `/usr/share/solt/solt_config` and change the paths to yours, maybe I going to add a create conf script for setting this up in the future
